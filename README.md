# jewel-tone-dark README

Hello my name is Maria Cromety, I decided to make my own visual studio code theme simply because I wanted to learn something new that I haven't learned. I decided to build my own theme because I wanted my own personal theme when I'm coding. The theme I decided to make was inspired by jewel tones simply because I love jewel tones. This is my second visual studio code theme I plan on building more in the future I hope you all like it.

Here are screenshots of what the theme is going to look like in your editor!
